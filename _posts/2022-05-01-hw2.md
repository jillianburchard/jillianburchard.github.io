For this project, I am creating a scraper for the movie, Catch Me if You Can, and providing recommendations based on movies 
that share the actors from Catch Me if You Can.

## From the movie page, navigate to the Cast&Crew page
### First Parse Method - Movie Page
1. After creating the class and saving the movie page's url as a list, define the first parse method
2. Index into the zero index of the movie url list and add "fullcredits", save this in a variable
3. Yield a request object that executes on the variable made in step 2. It's callback argument takes in the following parse method.
```
class ImdbSpider(scrapy.Spider):
    name = 'imdb_spider'

    start_urls = ['https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0264464/']

    def parse(self, response):
        cast_crew = self.start_urls[0] +  "fullcredits"
        
        yield scrapy.Request(cast_crew, callback= self.parse_full_credits)
```

### Second Parse Method - Full Credits
1. Create a list comprehension that will run a relative path for each actor, save it to the variable actor_path
2. Create a prefix variable for https://www.imdb.com/
3, Create an acot_urls variable that adds to the prefix and will run a for loop through actor_paths, this mimics clicking on the actor headshots
4. Create a for loop that indexes through actor_urls and yield a request object with a callback argument for the next parse method
```
def parse_full_credits(self, response):

        actor_path = [a.attrib["href"] for a in response.css("td.primary_photo a")]
        prefix = "https://www.imdb.com"
        actor_urls = [prefix + suffix for suffix in actor_path] #clicking on actor headshot to go to actor page

        for info in actor_urls: 
            yield scrapy.Request(info, callback = self.parse_actor_page)
           
```

### Third Parse Method - Actor Page
1. Create a response.css object to get the actor name
2. Create a for loop through a response.css object that contains the actor's movies and will iterate through this list of movies
3. Inside of the for loop create a response.css object that gets all the names of the movies
4. yield a dictionary that holds the actor's name and the movies they have been in
```
    def parse_actor_page(self, response):
        
        actor_name = response.css("span.itemprop::text").get()   #actor name 

        for movie in response.css("div.filmo-row b a::text").getall(): #get all the names of the movies the actor was in
            yield{
                "actor": actor_name,
                "movie" : movie
            }
```
### Recommendation
If you like the movie, Catch Me if You Can, these are 10 other movies you might like based on the shared actors

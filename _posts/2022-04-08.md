title: How to make a histogram with express
---
1. import pandas
2. from plotly import express
3. Assign the url containing your data to a variable
4. use pd.read_csv() to read the csv file and assign it to a variable, for this example the variable will be penguins
5. use px.histogram() and assign it to a variable. In this case the variable is fig
6. inside px. histogram(), put 'pengions,' then specify what your x-axis will be with 'x='. Using 'colors=', specify which component of the data will be represented by colors
7. You can also specify the transparency of the histograms using 'opacity=', the width of the frame using 'width=', and the height of the frame using 'height='
8. Finally, using the variable you created in step 5, in this case fig, run fig.show() to see the histogram you created
```
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px
```
```
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/palmer_penguins.csv"
penguins = pd.read_csv(url)
```
```
fig = px.histogram(penguins, 
                   x = "Body Mass (g)", 
                   color = "Species",
                   opacity = 0.5, 
                   nbins = 30, 
                   barmode='stack',
                   width = 600,
                   height = 300)

# reduce whitespace
fig.update_layout(margin={"r":0,"t":0,"l":0,"b":0})
# show the plot
fig.show()
```

title: How to make a histogram with express
---
1. import pandas
2. from plotly import express
3. Assign the url containing your data to a variable
4. use pd.read_csv() to read the csv file and assign it to a variable, for this example the variable will be penguins
5. use px.histogram() and assign it to a variable. In this case the variable is fig
6. inside px. histogram(), put 'pengions,' then specify what your x-axis will be with 'x='. Using 'colors=', specify which component of the data will be represented by colors
7. You can also specify the transparency of the histograms using 'opacity=', the width of the frame using 'width=', and the height of the frame using 'height='
8. Finally, using the variable you created in step 5, in this case fig, run fig.show() to see the histogram you created

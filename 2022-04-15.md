title: Exploring NOAA Climate Data 

## Creating a Database
1. I first began by importing pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, and sqlite3
```
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from plotly import express as px
import sqlite3
```

2. Using 'pd.read_csv' I read the data from temperatures, countries, and stations intro my notebook and assigned each csv to a variable
```
temps = pd.read_csv("temps_stacked.csv")
countries = pd.read_csv('countries.csv')
stations = pd.read_csv('station-metadata.csv')
```
3. I removed the white spaces in the countries' data country codes columns
```
countries = countries.rename(columns= {"FIPS 10-4": "FIPS_10-4"})
```
4. I opened a connection to the temps database so that I could 'talk' to it using python

```
conn = sqlite3.connect("temps.db")
temps.to_sql("temperatures", conn, if_exists="replace", index=False)
countries.to_sql("countries", conn, if_exists="replace", index=False)
stations.to_sql("stations", conn, if_exists="replace", index=False)

conn.close()
```
5. It is important to close a connection after you have opened it



## Creating a Query Function
1. I defined my function with 4 inputs
2. I opened a connection and utilized SQL to create the query
3. I used the pandas read sql function to read the SQL query into a dataframe
4. Close the connection

## A geographic scatter function for yearly temperature increases
1. Import plotly express and import LinearRegression from sklearn.linear_model
2. Create a function that computes the coefficient of a linear regression model tHat will be used on stations, this will reflect yearly changes in temperature
during the specified time
3. Create a function called temperature_coefficient_plot that takes in 5 inputs
4. Inside this function, create the sql query like the one made in the previoys problem
5. I then groupby station name, month, longitude, and latitude apply my coefficient function to these columns
6. Next I set up the scatter mapbox with the necessary attributes

## Show me the data for temperatures of a specified country Within a given range of latitudes in a specified month
1. Set up a function
2. Open SQL
3. Inside WHERE specify that the latitude needs to be in the range the user inputs
4. Inside WHERE, the month is what the user inputs
5. Inside WHERE, the country is what the user inputs. Utilize substring to take the first two letters of the users input in order to match it to the countries data. Make it not case sensitive

## What does temperature look like over a range of spefied months for a spefic cOuntry in a certain year?
1. Create a function
2. Open SQL and create the dataframe based on the inputs
3. Create a scatter plot with x as month and y as temp
4. Add necessary attributes to the plot

## What does the density of stations look like across the globe in a given set of years? I also want to see how many stations were in a country at this time.
1. Create a function
2. Open SQL to create the dataframe 
3. Get a count of the stations in each country for specified time
4. Create the density mapblox of this dataframe and add the necessary attributes
